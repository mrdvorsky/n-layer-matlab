%CALCULATE Calculate S11 for TE10 mode excitation.
% Computes the reflection coefficient of the rectangular waveguide TE10
% mode when looking into a multilayer structure defined by er, ur, thk at
% the frequencies defined by f.
%
% Example Usage:
%   NL = nLayerRectangular(maxM, maxN, band=wgBand);
%   gam = NL.calculate(f, er, ur, thk);
%   gam = NL.calculate(f, er, [], thk, AbsTol=1e-4);
%   gam = NL.calculate(f, [], ur, thk);
%
% Inputs:
%   f - Column vector of frequencies (GHz).
%   er - Array of complex relative permittivities for each layer. Every row
%       er(ff, :) should contain the permittivity of each layer at the
%       frequency f(ff). Pass in [] to use default value (1).
%   ur - Same as er, except for complex relative permeability.
%   thk - Vector of thicknesses for each layer. The length of thk should be
%       the same as the number of columns in er and ur. Last element can be
%       inf to represent an infinite half-space.
% Outputs:
%   gam - Column vector of reflection coefficients for the TE10 mode. Same
%       size as f.
